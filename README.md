# stim-balancer: A tool for balancing stimulus sets

Want to make sure your positive and negative stimuli don't significantly differ on arousal, or complexity, or luminance? Boy howdy do we have a tool for you.

Documentation and (hopefully) a web interface are coming later. Just the code for now.

Requires python 3.7, pandas, and statsmodels.
